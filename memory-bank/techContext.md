# Technical Context

## Purpose

This document outlines the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies, and tool usage patterns.

## Technologies

- **TypeScript**: Latest stable, primary development language for VS Code extensions
- **Node.js**: Latest LTS, runtime environment
- **VS Code API**: Latest, for extension development and UI integration
- **GitHub REST API**: v3. Key endpoints used:
  - `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{tree_sha}?recursive=1`: Fetches the entire repository file tree structure efficiently.
  - `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}`: Downloads individual file content.
  - `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}`: Retrieves the SHA of the default branch head for initial tree fetching.

## Development Environment

- **Operating System**: macOS (primary), cross-platform compatible
- **IDE/Editor**: VS Code
- **Required Tools**:
  - Node.js and npm
  - Yeoman and VS Code Extension Generator
  - Git

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Install Yeoman and VS Code Extension Generator: `npm install -g yo generator-code`
3. Generate extension scaffold: `yo code`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Open project in VS Code

## Build Process

```
1. Compile TypeScript: npm run compile
2. Watch mode for development: npm run watch
3. Package extension: npm run package (creates .vsix file)
```

## Deployment Process

```
1. Package extension: npm run package
2. Install from VSIX: code --install-extension your-extension.vsix
3. Publish to VS Code Marketplace (future consideration)
```

## Dependencies

### Frontend

- **VS Code API**: For UI integration and extension functionality
- **VS Code WebView API**: For custom views if needed

### Backend

- **Node.js https module**: For GitHub API requests
- **Node.js fs module**: For file system operations

### Development

- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **ESLint**: For code quality (`eslint.config.mjs`, `npm run lint:fix`)
- **@types/***: Type definitions for dev dependencies

## API Integrations

- **GitHub REST API (v3)**:
  - **Git Trees (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{tree_sha}?recursive=1`)**: Primary endpoint for fetching the full repository structure efficiently. Handles nested directories in a single call. [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree)
  - **Repository Contents (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}`)**: Used to download the content of individual files selected by the user. [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents#get-repository-content)
  - **Branches (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}`)**: Used initially to get the commit SHA of the target branch's head, which is needed as the `{tree_sha}` for the Git Trees API call. [Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/branches/branches#get-a-branch)
  - **Authentication**: Uses optional Personal Access Token (PAT) provided via the `aidd.githubToken` VS Code setting in the `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` header to handle private repositories and increase rate limits.
- **VS Code Extension API**: Core API for all extension functionality, including TreeView, commands, configuration (`vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('aidd')`), notifications, file system access, status bar (`vscode.window.createStatusBarItem`), workspace state (`context.workspaceState`) for storing downloaded file SHAs, etc. [Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api)

## Technical Constraints

- **GitHub API Rate Limiting**: Applies to all requests. Unauthenticated requests have lower limits (60/hour). Authenticated requests using the PAT via the `aidd.githubToken` setting have significantly higher limits (5000/hour). Rate limit information is checked in API responses.
- **GitHub API `truncated` Flag**: The `git/trees` API endpoint (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{tree_sha}?recursive=1`) may return a `truncated: true` field in the response if the repository contains more than 100,000 files. Handling this scenario (e.g., notifying the user, potentially fetching in chunks if possible) is not currently implemented (see Technical Debt in `systemPatterns.md`).
- **VS Code Extension Performance**: Processing and rendering potentially large file trees (especially after a `git/trees` call) in the TreeView needs to be performant to avoid UI freezes.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: File system paths and operations (`fs` module) must be handled carefully to work across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Using `path.join` and `path.sep` is recommended.

## Monitoring and Logging

Extension will use VS Code's output channel for logging during development and debugging. Error reporting will be handled through VS Code's notification system for end users.
